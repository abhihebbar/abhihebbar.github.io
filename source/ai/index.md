Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence exhibited by machines or software. It is also the name of the academic field of study which studies how to create computers and computer software that are capable of intelligent behavior

I have always been facinated by AI. The idea of programming intelligence is very intriguing to me. Si-Fi movie characters like [JARVIS](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.) exponentially increased my curiosity towards AI.

I went trough couple of very interesting online courses on AI from [Barkleys](https://www.edx.org/course/artificial-intelligence-uc-berkeleyx-cs188-1x) and [MIT](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/index.htm?utm_source=OCWDept&utm_medium=CarouselSm&utm_campaign=FeaturedCourse). I loved the course, and I strongly recomend those course to anyone interested. They are very informative, interesting and fun.

Folloing completion of those courses, I have been doing a lot of experiments on AI. Few hypothetical thought experiments, and a few on potential applications.

Few ideas around AI that I am experimenting with.

* **AI Programmer** - Some code that could write conceptually repetative programs for me, based on specific instructions provided.
* **Smart organiser** - A google now like question answering system that know fully about me. My data, my online profiles, my works and can potentially answer my questions like an personal assistant.
* **The Black Swan and AI** - Hypothetical. How can an AI work, if it has a capacity to prove or disprove a belief. Should it try to disprove its current strong belief or otherwise. Very loosly based on the [Black Swan theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)
* **AI for settings** - Automatic default preferences for user - Inspired by a talk at [Wordcamp Mumbai](https://mumbai.wordcamp.org/2015/)
