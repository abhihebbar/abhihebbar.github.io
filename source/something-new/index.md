*"I get bored very, very, very... quickly."*

So, to keep myself interested I try something new very often. Most of the time I end up experimenting with tech.

Currently, I am experimenting with.

* **[AI](/ai/)** - When I can program to think, I feel like paying god.
* **[Block Chains](/block-chain/)** - Data protection and programmed contracts.
* **[Rapid development](/rapid-development/)** - Evergreen - Develop anything & everything, really fast.
