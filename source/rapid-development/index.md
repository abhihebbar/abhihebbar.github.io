{% blockquote Wikipedia  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development  (Article)%}
Rapid Development approaches to software development put less emphasis on planning tasks and more emphasis on development. In contrast to the waterfall model, which emphasizes rigorous specification and planning, RAD approaches emphasize the necessity of adjusting requirements in reaction to knowledge gained as the project progresses.

I love to put ideas into practical experiments. And Rapid development gives the just the right approach to do that. I try to quickly build something on a very preliminary idea, to validate and make the idea itself clearer (Very rough [prototype](/prototyping)).

I always keep a set of tools, frameworks and libraries ready for rapid development. These tools keep evolving all the time. I also write a few lines of code to enable rapid development for myself (I highly recomend anyone not to use those; zero documentation and very hard to understand without one).

### My current toolbox

* **Platforms**
  * [Node JS](https://nodejs.org) - Javascript runtime. Love this language and platform for simplicity and flexibility.
  * [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk) & [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) - Trying something on mobile, they are the only options. (I dont like cross-platform dev tools like [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/), [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) or [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/))

* **Tools**
  * [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) - The web's scaffolding tool for modern webapps.
  * [Emmet](http://emmet.io/) - Editors plugins that makes development possible at superhuan speeds.
  * [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) - With a lot of plugins and snippets.

* **Libraries**
  * [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) or [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - Web application frameworks for node JS.
  * [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) - My favourite templating language.
  * [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) & [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/) - Quikly build beautiful UI.
  * [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) - Quickly create a mock REST API.
