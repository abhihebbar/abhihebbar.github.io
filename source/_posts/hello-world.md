I decided to do little more blogging (and lot more self promotion). So, updating my personal site.

**Welcome**, to the rebuilt site! I'm excited to put a brand new look, and lots of new content.

I have used a new set of tools, template and hosting for this site, thanks to Open source. They together provide me a more clean way to host, maintain and update. Here is a list of everything I have used to get this site up.

### [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)
{% blockquote "Hexo Website"  https://hexo.io/  (Link)%}
A fast, simple & powerful blog framework
{% endblockquote %}

I choose hexo because

* Does everything I want.
* Themeing is very easy (EJS).
* Posts and pages as a markdown files - love it.
* Can be deployed as static site (No slow loading).
* Can deploy to github pages.
* It's in node JS, a very familiar platform.

### [HTML-UP](http://html5up.net/)

I downloaded this theme from [HTML-UP](http://html5up.net/).

### [Github](https://github.com)

Source code repository. As posts and pages are saved as file in hexo, having a git repo for the sources is a must. Github serves that purpose and also solves my hosting problem with [github pages](https://pages.github.com).

The entire source code for this site is also available [here](https://github.com/abhihebbar/abhihebbar.github.io) at github.
